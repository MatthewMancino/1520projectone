## Project #2 Proposal

The second part of my project will be implementing a user login feature as a part of the homepage of my blog. I intend to run this website
on a home server, XAMPP running on Ubuntu on a custom-built gaming PC, but I disgress. I want the website to have a full user/member area with correct security concerns implemented.

### Differences
  What I am going to do differently is focus on much more back-end structuring so that it resembles a fully functional web service, instead
  of a static webpage.
  1. Develop an interactive webpage that uses animations during things like clicking through to the login portal.
  2. Create a simple back-end PHP framework that stores user login information and allows them to comment and share content.
  3. Improve the design of the front-end by implementing more bootstrap features
