## Project #2 Proposal

The second part of my project will be implementing a user login feature as a part of the homepage of my blog. I intend to run this website
on a home server, XAMPP running on Ubuntu on a custom-built gaming PC, but I disgress. I want the website to have a full user/member area with correct security concerns implemented.

### Improvements
  The improvements I want to make to the website include adding OOP PHP classes to handle logging into the member's portion of the website, as well as having saved favorites, or content that some people have favorited.

### Differences
  This differs from the first portion in that; finishing the addition of a static interface via bootstrap, adding interactivity in the form of the login page, and clicking through to other content, and creating a back-end user database responsible for storing information.
  of a static webpage.
  1. Finish Bootstrap front-end framework to align the coherent whole of the design
  2. Create a simple back-end PHP framework that stores user login information and allows them to comment, favorite, and share content.
  3. Improve the interactive design by adding some JavaScript to make the site slightly more interactive

### Overall design
  The overall design of the website shall resemble a modern news website. Complete with *intra-website functionality*, meaning a user can click through to another easily accessible article by clicking the links. Also if a user wants to save content, favorite specific articles, or share with friends, it should be easily accessible.
